        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "1 m³ = 1000 L → 180 m³/h = 180,000 L/h. 1 hour = 3600 s → 180,000 ÷ 3,600 = 50 L/s."

        "correctAnswer": 0,
        "explanation": "mass = volume × density = 12,500 × 0.875 = 12,500 × (7/8) = (12,500 ÷ 8) × 7 = 1,562.5 × 7 = 10,937.5 kg. Correct!"
